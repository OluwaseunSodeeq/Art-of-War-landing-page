            <h3>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</h3>
            <p class="CCC">The GREATEST <br> MILITARY STRATEGIST</p>
            <p class="BBB">The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was <br> born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later <br> Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was <br> born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the <br> late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a <br> general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth <br> century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then <br> inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of <br> the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent <br> Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven <br> ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and <br> Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in <br> Eastern China.

                <p>THE ART OF WAR</p>
                <p>This Collectable Hardbound Deluxe Edition is beautifully crafted and <br> designed. Perfect for gifting as well as for keeps. A prized edition for any <br> library. The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life <br> and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry <br> which can on no account be neglected. The Art of War is an enduring classic <br> that holds a special place in the culture and history of East Asia. An ancient <br> Chinese text on the philosophy and politics of warfare and military strategy,<br> the treatise was written in 6th century B.C. by a warrior-philosopher now <br> famous all over the world as Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu s teachings remain as relevant <br> to leaders and strategists today as they were to rulers and military generals <br> in ancient times. Divided into thirteen chapters and written succinctly, The <br> Art of War is a must read for anybody who works in an competitive <br> environment or who is interested in warfare, strategy and Chinese history.
